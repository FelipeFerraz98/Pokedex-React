# Pokedex - Taqtile Challenge

## About

This project is an incomplete Pokedex App using React Native. Your task is to finish this project using data from a Rest API, create a details page to check for pokemon's stats and implement a share feature to send some pokeculture to your friends.

The main purpose of this challenge is not evaluate the candidates' knowledge of react native or front-end development but to show us how they solve a problem and how they study for it.

The candidates should think this challenge as their first task working at Taqtile, so what they delivery in this challenge is what we would expect from their work in a real project given the same constraints.

## TODOs

- [ ] Use a FlatList component in List.js;
- [ ] Refactor all styles to use `styled-components`
- [ ] Implement a navigation from the List page to the Details page using `react-navigation`;
- [ ] Create the Pokemon Details Page using the provided [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/m7h8wWZO3u6qCC3Edw1BGU/taqchallenge-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1) as reference;
- [ ] Use [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to populate the Pokemon List Page (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon);
- [ ] Use  [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to populate the Pokemon Details Page (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto);
- [ ] Implement a share button in the Details page to share a message with the Pokemon's stats.

## General guidelines

The candidates' solution is not required to be exactly equal to the provided Figma design. It should be only be used as an example of what atributes are desired to be found on the details page.

We ask for the candidates to *do not* share their final code to their classmates or to ask for others the solution of this challenge. The candidate is more than welcome to ask us for any doubts or problems, discuss possible solutions with their colleagues and share interesting references with them.

The candidates should send us their final solution in format of a Snack in their account.

The candidates should send us the references they used to complete the challenge in the file **references.txt**.

## Tips

- To get the best image for the pokemons use the following url pattern: 

  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/<pokemon-number>.png`

  example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/1.png` for bulbasaur:

  ![bulbasur](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/1.png)
  

- Double-check the version of the library's documentation you are reading. The web version of Expo does not support the latest version of all libraries we are using in this challenge, therefore we set up this project using some known working ones..
